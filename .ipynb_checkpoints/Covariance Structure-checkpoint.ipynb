    "What the above equations tell us is that we will have two slightly different ways of calculating an individual's variance for any $t,h>1$, depending on whether $h \\leq t$ or $h > t$. Intuitively, this is due to the fact that when $h > t$, the individual has already accumulated a history of shocks at $t=1$, the first period of observation. In this case, the recursion for $var(z_{h,t}^i)$ will end with the $var(z_{h,1}^i)$ term, so individuals will differ based on how many working years they accrued before the start of the sample (these are individuals who started work prior to 1968). If $h \\leq t$, the recursion ends in $var(z_{1,t}^i)$, so individuals will only differ in the first shock they experienced upon entering the sample at the start of their working life (these are individuals who start work after 1968).\n",

The maximum age that a 4-year-cohort could reach (without considering the length of the sample) is 41 - upon entering the age-midpoint is 22 (ages 20-24), while the cohort exits the sample with an age midpoint of 62 (ages 60-64). For this reason, every cohort will have a $(41x41)$ matrix holding all possible variances and covariances for each year of life, although only a maximum of 29 values will be found in each column (the maximum lag length). \n",
