    "What the above equations tell us is that we will have two slightly different ways of calculating an individual's variance for any $t,h>1$, depending on whether $h \\leq t$ or $h > t$. Intuitively, this is due to the fact that when $h > t$, the individual has already accumulated a history of shocks at $t=1$, the first period of observation. In this case, the recursion for $var(z_{h,t}^i)$ will end with the $var(z_{h,1}^i)$ term, so individuals will differ based on how many working years they accrued before the start of the sample (these are individuals who started work prior to 1968). If $h \\leq t$, the recursion ends in $var(z_{1,t}^i)$, so individuals will only differ in the first shock they experienced upon entering the sample at the start of their working life (these are individuals who start work after 1968).\n",

    "The problem with the above is that we have data for years 1968 to 1997, and then 1999 to 2013 in two-yearly releases. That means in total there are 38 observations rather than the 29 above, but we have to be a bit careful as individuals in the sample age two years for each observation towards the end (that is someone who e.g. has been in the sample for 19 years in 1997, but is 63 year olds at that time, will not be able to record a 20th observation, as he is 65 during the next survey in 1999).\n",
