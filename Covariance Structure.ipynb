    "What the above equations tell us is that we will have two slightly different ways of calculating an individual's variance for any $t,h>1$, depending on whether $h \\leq t$ or $h > t$. Intuitively, this is due to the fact that when $h > t$, the individual has already accumulated a history of shocks at $t=1$, the first period of observation. In this case, the recursion for $var(z_{h,t}^i)$ will end with the $var(z_{h,1}^i)$ term, so individuals will differ based on how many working years they accrued before the start of the sample (these are individuals who started work prior to 1968). If $h \\leq t$, the recursion ends in $var(z_{1,t}^i)$, so individuals will only differ in the first shock they experienced upon entering the sample at the start of their working life (these are individuals who start work after 1968)."
